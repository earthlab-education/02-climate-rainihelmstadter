    "# Climate Change in Bozeman, Montana\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will analyze temperature data in Bozeman, MT to investigate for a warming trend due to climate change. I am using data from the GHCND dataset from NCEI - Station ID (USC00241044). I'll be using a simple linear regression to do this analysis, which certainly has limitations, but is a good place to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conditions for linear OLS regression are largely met by my data: \n",
    "- Temperature is a constantly fluctuating value, rather than something precipitation or wind speed, so it is safe to assume it is normally distributed. In addition, by aggregating the data to an annual mean, I have further reduced the potential impact of extreme values. \n",
    "- The warming I expect to see should be fairly linear, given that climate change is slow moving, relative to an annual scale. We may want to move to a polynomial fit, but linear regression is a good place to start. \n",
    "- Lastly, while Bozeman is probably influenced by hysteresis in the climate system to some extent (e.g. ice caps, oceanic teleconnections), the anomaly potentially introduced is likely negligible at this point, so we can assume the data are stationary.\n",
    "\n",
    "If time allows, I'd also like to investigate snowfall amounts for a climate change signal. However, that will be a little bit harder, as precipitation data on a daily scale is a non-Gaussian data product.\n"

Using an extension (DataWrangler, from Microsoft), I've taken a look at the beginning of the dataset, and each year until 1933 is missing at least a month of data - often multiple months at a time. So, it seems fairly reasonable to exlude any data from before 1933, as the data aren't reliable enough to make an sort of statistical analysis. In addition, I've got information from most of 2025, but not all, so we'll want to exclude that.\n"
